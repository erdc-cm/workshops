title: ERDC-FSI April 2016
---

# ERDC Fluid-Structure Interaction R&D Workshop, April 14-15, 2016

Both the DoD and industry increasingly demand high-fidelity models of
Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI). Examples include waves and currents
interacting with

- moored platforms and bridges,
- flood protection structures,
- granular materials (soil and sea ice), and
- autonomous vessels and vehicles.

**The overarching objective of this
  meeting is to promote technical exchange in a small group setting to support
  the development of new mechanistic theories and computational methods for
  coupled fluid-solid systems, with specific attention to critical concerns of
  the USACE and the DoD.**

## Location and Directions

*Conference Facility*, Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory, US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, 3909 Halls Ferry Road, Vicksburg, MS 39180 ([Map](https://goo.gl/maps/5ZGQaCggdZk))

You will proceed through the front gate on Halls Ferry and continue down the hill past the red brick ACE-IT building, over the spillway, and to a four-way stop. Turn left at the four-way stop onto Delaware road and proceed up the hill and into the CHL parking lot on the left. Park in any spot labeled visitor  or any unlabeled spot. Check in and receive your badge in the CHL foyer.
