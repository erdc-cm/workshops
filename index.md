title: ERDC-FSI April 2016
---

# ERDC Fluid-Structure Interaction R&D Workshop

## Objectives

There is growing demand for high-fidelity models of FSI within the DoD and
industry. Examples include waves and currents interacting with

- moored platforms and bridges,
- flood protection structures,
- granular materials (soil and sea ice), and
- autonomous vessels and vehicles.

There is also a long history of research in computational methods for FSI,
which has resulted in a range of powerful tools such as ALE, level set,
immersed boundary, meshless, and particle methods, to mention just a
few. Nevertheless, significant technological gaps remain for the application of
FSI modeling to certain critical problems. Open areas include validation of
existing 3D approaches, new approaches for over-topping and erosion processes,
efficient coupling of object-wave-current dynamics, and the dynamics of
variably saturated granular structures. **The overarching objective of this
  meeting is to promote technical exchange in a small group setting to support
  the development of new mechanistic theories and computational methods for
  coupled fluid-solid systems, with specific attention to critical concerns of
  the USACE and the DoD.**
