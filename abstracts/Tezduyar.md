# Space–time FSI computation: it’s worth it

Tayfun Tezduyar, Rice

Computational analysis of fluid–structure interactions (FSI) and flows with
moving boundaries and interfaces (MBI) quite often requires high-resolution
representation of boundary layers near solid surfaces. Moving-mesh methods,
such as the ALE and space–time (ST) methods, where the mesh moves to follow the
fluid–solid interface, enables that high-resolution representation. However,
moving-mesh methods are quite often thought of as being not practical in
computation of complex FSI and MBI problems. Actually they are practical in
more classes of complex FSI and MBI problems than commonly thought of. We show
what a good moving-mesh method can now do, and what a good ST method can do
beyond that, which now includes being able to maintain high-resolution
representation of boundary layers near moving solid surfaces even when there is
contact between the solid surfaces. We show how these advanced ST FSI methods
we have developed enable accurate computational analysis in many classes of FSI
and MBI problems, ranging from spacecraft parachute FSI to wind-turbine
aerodynamics, from flapping-wing aerodynamics of an actual locust to fluid
mechanics of a heart valve model. This is a joint work with Professor Kenji
Takizawa, Department of Modern Mechanical Engineering, Waseda University,
Tokyo.
