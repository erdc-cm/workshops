# Invariant domains preserving ale approximation of hyperbolic systems with continuous finite elements

Jean-Luc Guermond and Bojan Popov, Texas A&M

A conservative invariant domain preserving Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method
for solving nonlinear hyperbolic systems is introduced. The method is explicit
in time, works with continuous finite elements and is first-order accurate in
space. The method is based on an artificial viscosity which unambiguously
defined irrespective of the mesh geometry/anisotropy and does not depend on any
ad hoc parameter. The proposed method is meant to be a stepping stone for the
construction of higher-order methods in space by using appropriate limitation
techniques.


The originality of the present work is that (i) The approximation in space is
done with continuous finite elements of arbitrary order; (ii) The local shape
functions can be linear Lagrange elements, Bernstein-Bezier elements of any
order or any other nonnegative functions (not necessarily polynomials) that
have the partition of unity property; (iii) The finite element meshes
considered are non- uniform, curvilinear and the space dimension is arbitrary;
(iv) The artificial viscosity is unambiguously defined irrespective of the mesh
geometry/anisotropy, does not depend on any ad hoc parameter, contrary to what
has been previously done in the finite element literature, and leads to precise
invariant domain properties and entropy inequalities; (v) The methods works for
any hyperbolic system.
