# Using Proteus for fast prototyping and numerical methods research

Alistair Bentley, Clemson

One of Proteus' strengths is that it allows researchers to quickly setup and
solve a wide range of physical problems using a variety of state of the art
numerical techniques. In this demonstration, we illustrate some of this
flexibility using a Navier-Stokes driven cavity problem. In particular, we show
how to run the driven-cavity problem with different finite element spaces,
linear solvers and boundary condition algorithms on a Jupyter Notebook.
