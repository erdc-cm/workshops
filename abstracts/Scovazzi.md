# The shifted Nitsche method: A new approach to embedded/immersed boundary conditions

Guglielmo Scovazzi, Duke

Embedded boundary methods obviate the need for continual re-meshing in many
applications involving rapid prototyping and design. Unfortunately, many finite
element embedded boundary methods for incompressible flow are also difficult to
implement due to the need to perform complex cell cutting operations at
boundaries. We present a new, stable, and simple embedded boundary method,
which we call “the shifted Nitsche method,” which eliminates the need to
perform cell cutting, and demonstrate it on large-scale incompressible flow
problems. Time permitting, we will also describe an immersed boundary version
of the method for fluid-structure interaction computations.
