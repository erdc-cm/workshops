# Simulating waves: proteus.WaveTools and wave/structure tutorials

Aggelos Dimakopoulos, [HR Wallingford](http://www.hrwallingford.com)

In this tutorial session, we will go through a brief description of the classes
and available wave theories in the wave generation module,
proteus.WaveTools. Examples for using the module's classes will be given
through [Jupyter](http://juypter.org) notebooks. Subsequently, examples for
setting up a numerical flume for modelling wave interaction with fixed and
mobile structures will be presented to the audience and animations from recent
work in progress will be shown.
