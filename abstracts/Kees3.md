# [Proteus](http://proteustoolkit.org) roadmap and discussion

Chris Kees, CHL

A survey of past and current projects will presented to provide a context for
some of the afternoon discussions. The discussion will include technological
gaps such as

- Collisions
- Erosion and deposition
- Parallel scalability

Not all gaps can be framed as math, engineering, or computational science
challenges. Other important aspects of successful software will be discussed,
including

- Regression testing
- Development and release strategies
- Cooperation with other organizations
- Governance
