# Introduction to Proteus and basic tutorials

Chris Kees, CHL

[Proteus](http://proteustoolkit.org) is a toolkit for computational methods and
simulation. This set of tutorials will cover the basic Python package and how
to run simulations

1. from the command line,
2. as a Python script, and
3. as a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebook.

The two main objectives of Proteus's design were to make it easy to add new
models ("physics") and to enable their solution with multiple numerical methods
("numerics"). To illustrate these capabilities, several sets of physics
will be developed and solved with some of the available sets of numerics. Finally,
a brief overview of how the toolkit supports a computational simulator for wave
flumes will provided.
